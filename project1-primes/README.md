Project 1: Primes
===

This first project's goal is to create a program that calculates prime numbers, using the 'Sieve of Erathosthenes'-method.

The program should take one integer as a parameter, and print all primes up to that number.

Think about what can go wrong, and make your program robust.

Example
---

Running the application as follows:

    sbt "run 25"

should give the following output:

    3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23
